# google-translate

A clojure wrapper for the
[Google Translate API](https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-translate/latest/index.html
"Google Translate Javadocs").

## Install
Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [google-translate "0.1.0"]

## Credentials

Follow link to set up credentials, billing, etc...

<https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup>

You'll need credentials to make api calls. These can be specified via
an environment variable where `[PATH]` is the path to the json
credentials for a particular google project.  This is the project
where any charges will be accounted for.

``` shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```

You can use an `api-key` as an alternative.

``` clojure
{:api-key "your api key"}
```

Store (and gitignore) it in `../config/creds.edn`. Then set the authentication method to use an `api-key` instead of the environment variable.


``` clojure
(set-authentication-method! :api-key)
```

## Usage

``` clojure
(detect "hola") => {:language "es", :confidence 0.91015625}

(translate! "hola mundo") => "Hello World"
(translate! "hola mundo" :from "es" :to "it") => "Ciao mondo"
```
